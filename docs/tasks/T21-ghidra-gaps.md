# T21 — Close the Ghidra decompile gaps (issue #97)

**Status:** in progress · **Depends on:** T05, T07, T11, T12e, T17, T20 · **Issue:** [#97](https://github.com/Reid-n0rc/FT-710_Firmware/issues/97)

## Goal
Close every known gap in the Ghidra decompiles listed in #97, so `decomp/` is decompiled C that can be trusted. Part A (HiFi4 FLIX
bundles, a SLEIGH generator from Cadence's MIT-licensed `xtensa-modules.c`) is the main work; part B covers the smaller MAIN and
DISPLAY gaps (B1–B8) and a regression check for all images (B11). Analysis and tooling only; no radio.

## Plan
Owner: parent agent, branch `issue-97-ghidra-gaps`, 2026-10-28. Work is split into sub-tasks that run in parallel, each in its own
worktree, each committing after every step:

| Sub-task | Items in #97 | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| T21a | A steps 1–6, 9 | `tools/xtensa_sleigh_gen.py` and the generated language `Xtensa:LE:32:rt600hifi4` (SLEIGH + ldefs/pspec/cspec), installed by `tools/bootstrap.sh` |
| T21b | A step 7, B9, B10 | the test oracle: a Ghidra listing export plus `tools/flix_compare.py` against `flix.dis` (all 49,389 instructions); function list matched to `flix.dis` |
| T21c | B1, B4 | RXv2 coverage diff against GNU binutils `rx-elf-objdump`; SLEIGH patch for any missing RXv2 op and for the string ops as named pcodeops |
| T21d | B2, B3, B5 | MAIN: spacebase fixes, call-argument/return mismatch counter and `signatures_main.tsv` + script, string/pointer-table definition |
| T21e | B6, B7, B8 | DISPLAY: jump-table recovery, missed function starts, undefined fragments |
| T21f | B11 | decompile-quality counts per image in `INDEX.md`; `tools/bootstrap.sh verify` fails if any count gets worse |
| T21g | A step 8, integration | canonical Ghidra projects re-imported with all fixes, `decomp/` re-exported, docs (`INDEX.md`, `hifi4.md`, `ghidra-flix.md`, `tooling.md`) updated |

Rules for the sub-tasks:
- Work on per-task Ghidra copies (`ghidra/FT710_<IMAGE>_T21x`, gitignored). Only T21g writes the canonical projects and re-exports
  `decomp/`, so the binary projects never conflict.
- Inputs come from the main checkout's `build/` (read only).
- Ghidra runs go through a slot limiter (at most 3 at once, 3 GB heap each) so the 15 GB machine does not run out of memory.
- Every step: commit, heartbeat, and record findings in this file's sub-task section and in `docs/`.
